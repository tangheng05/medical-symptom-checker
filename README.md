## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/medical-symptom-checker.git
   cd medical-symptom-checker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Open in browser:**

   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 📖 Usage

1. **Enter Temperature**: Input your body temperature in Celsius (35-43°C)
2. **Rate Symptoms**: Use sliders to rate each symptom from 0 (none) to 10 (severe)
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Symptoms" to get results
4. **Review Results**: Check diagnoses, confidence scores, and recommendations

## 🌐 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

This app is configured for easy deployment to Vercel:

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Visit [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Your app will be live at `your-project.vercel.app`

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions, troubleshooting, and configuration options.

### Other Platforms

This Flask app can also be deployed to:
- **Heroku**: Add a `Procfile` with `web: gunicorn app:app`
- **PythonAnywhere**: Upload files and configure WSGI
- **Railway**: Auto-detects Flask apps
- **Render**: Configure as a web service

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: Loads disease database and recommendation rules from JSON files
2. **Symptom Collection**: User inputs via interactive sliders and temperature field
3. **Weighted Analysis**: Calculates confidence scores using symptom weights
4. **Temperature Correlation**: Adjusts probabilities based on temperature range matching
5. **Severity Assessment**: Evaluates critical symptoms and overall condition
6. **Recommendations**: Generates personalized advice based on diagnosis and severity

## 🎓 Supported Conditions

- COVID-19 (Coronavirus)
- Seasonal Influenza (Flu)
- Common Cold
- Strep Throat
- Sinusitis
- Bronchitis
- Seasonal Allergies
- Pneumonia
- Migraine

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**This is an educational project with limitations:**

- ✅ Great for learning expert systems and Flask development
- ✅ Demonstrates rule-based AI and medical decision-making
- ⚠️ Limited to 9 common conditions
- ⚠️ Uses rule-based logic, not machine learning
- ⚠️ Does not consider age, gender, or medical history
- ⚠️ Not validated by medical professionals
- ❌ **NOT suitable for actual medical diagnosis**

**Always seek professional medical advice for health concerns.**
